# PhishThis


Ever get excessively bothered by the test phishing emails InfoSec sends to educate you and your co-workers?
PhishThis is here to help. It will watch your gmail inbox and detect when a test phishing email is received. Once detected PhishThis will delete the email from your inbox and forward a copy back to the InfoSec team making it appear you are exceptionally vigillant.

PhishThis uses the X-PHISHTEST header to detect emails sent by KnowBe4
